# simple_GA
This is a simple implementation of the genetic algorithm. The goal is to find
the (optimal) solution. The solution is by default or given by the user.
Normaly, the solution depends on the evolution of individuals of the population.
But in this case the evelution of the individuals continiuos until an individual
has the same gene string as the solution. This results in a different number of
generations every time the programm executes.

### Run
Compile the programm:

	make

Run the programm:

	./bin/genalg
